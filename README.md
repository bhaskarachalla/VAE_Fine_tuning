# VAE Fine-tuning

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for image generation and fine-tuning on custom datasets. The primary goal is to demonstrate the process of adapting a pre-trained VAE model to generate high-quality images based on user-defined parameters.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- torchvision


## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages.

## Usage

### Fine-tuning the VAE

To fine-tune the VAE on your custom dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Ensure your dataset is in the appropriate format (e.g., images in a directory).

2. **Configure Training Parameters**: Modify the training parameters in the provided configuration file or directly in the script.

3. **Run the Training Script**.

### Generating Images

Once the model is fine-tuned, you can generate images by:

1. **Loading the Fine-tuned Model**.
2. **Generating Images with Specific Parameters**.

## Dataset

You can use any dataset of images for fine-tuning. It is recommended to use a dataset that is diverse and contains enough examples for effective learning. Ensure your dataset is properly organized.

## Training Process

The training process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed.
2. **Model Initialization**: A pre-trained VAE model is initialized.
3. **Fine-tuning**: The model is fine-tuned using the provided dataset for a specified number of epochs.
4. **Saving the Model**: The fine-tuned model is saved for later use.
